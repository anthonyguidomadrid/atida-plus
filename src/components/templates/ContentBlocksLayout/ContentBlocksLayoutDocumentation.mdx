# ContentBlocksLayout Component
This component is responsible for providing container rules and spacing between different types of content blocks.
It is responsive, meaning that the spaces between content blocks will be consistent with
[design](https://www.figma.com/file/CXeimsVvCEy7sRBtcm4rm2/Atida-%E2%80%94-Library?node-id=4643%3A13507) on all screen sizes.
The colored blocks represent the content blocks. Their height is irrelevant, what matters is the space between them
and their distance to the sides of the canvas.

## Usage
The new ContentBlocksLayout component can be used as part of any page. Generally the page shouldn't add container rules
around the ContentBlocksLayout component, because it's provided in it.<br />
With the help of the `isContainer` prop, which has the default value of `true`, this can be further fine-tuned.
If it's set to `false` the component will take up the full width of its parent component.<br />
On their part, each content block should add a `w-full` to their top most element, so that they fill out the space provided by the layout component.
The `contentBlocks` prop needs to receive an array of content blocks, it has the type `ContentBlock[]`.
